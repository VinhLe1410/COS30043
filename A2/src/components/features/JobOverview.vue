    EDM star and international DJ Martin Garrix recently opened up about feeling burnt out during a podcast interview.
    The producer sat down to chat about his upcoming projects, life on the road, and the struggles that come with constant touring.
    His honesty has sparked conversations about the challenges musicians face and how their busy lifestyles can affect mental health.
    <br /><br />
    Garrix admitted that while he loves touring and performing for fans, it can be really draining.
    "Touring has always been a dream come true, but it's exhausting," he said.
    "You're always on the move, rarely get proper rest, and there's little time to reflect or recharge."
    <br /><br />
    Even though he's passionate about his music, the constant cycle of travelling, performing, and working on new projects has left him feeling worn out.
    The 28-year-old DJ has been in the music industry for over ten years, performing at huge festivals around the world and creating hit songs that have inspired millions.
    But like many artists, the non-stop schedule can sometimes be overwhelming.
    <br /><br />
    After the podcast aired, fans flooded social media with messages of support.
    Many people appreciated how open he was about his struggles, showing that even successful artists face tough times.
    <br /><br />
    Despite feeling burnt out, Garrix is using this time to slow down and focus on making new music.
    He shared that he's been spending more time in the studio, working with other talented artists, and getting back to what he lovesâ€”creating fresh tracks.
    He hinted that he's excited to write more pop-EDM anthems, like his past hits 'In the Name of Love' with Bebe Rexha and 'Scared to Be Lonely' with Dua Lipa.
    <br /><br />
    As more artists speak out about their mental health, Garrix's honesty is a reminder that it's okay to take a break and focus on self-care.
    Fans are excited to see what he creates next after getting some well-deserved rest.
